## Overview

memer is a a `tidyverse`-compatible `R` package for creating memes. Mostly wrappers around `magick` functions. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sctyner/memer")
```

## Available Memes

```{r}
library(memer)
meme_list()
```

## Usage

```{r cdistbf, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
meme_get("DistractedBf") %>% 
  meme_text_distbf("tidyverse", "new R users", "base R")
```

```{r oprah, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
meme_get("OprahGiveaway") %>% 
  meme_text_bottom("EVERYONE GETS A %>%!!!", size = 36)
```

```{r chopper, fig.align="center", out.width="40%"}
meme_get("AmericanChopper") %>%
  meme_text_chopper("Stop calling yourself 'just an R user'!",
                    "But I've never written a package!",
                    "So?? You're still an important part of the R community!",
                    "But people who write packages are more important",
                    "NO! All members of the R community are valued & deserve respect!")
```


## Post R Memes directly to Twitter!

```{r brain, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
meme_get("ExpandingBrain") %>% 
  meme_text_brain("Sharing memes online", 
                  "Making your own memes", 
                  "Making memes in R", 
                  "Using rtweet to share your memes", 
                  size = 17)
```

You can also post memes directly to Twitter. You will need to install the [rtweet](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/) package for that. Just make sure to set up a Twitter token ([see here for more information on that](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html)) and you are good to go. The `meme_tweet` function also includes the possibility to tag the [R Memes for Statistical Fiends](https://twitter.com/rstatsmemes) account on Twitter for maximum exposure :)

```{r, post_memes_1, eval=F}
meme_get("DosEquisMan") %>% 
  meme_text_top("I don't always tweet memes", size = 28) %>% 
  meme_text_bottom("But when I do\nI use the memer package in R", size = 26) %>%
  meme_tweet(tweet_text = "It's dangerous to meme alone. Here take this.",
             tag_rstatsmemes = T)
```

```{r post_memes_2, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/XvKhZZc.png")
```

## Confused? Use `meme_explain()`! 

Using `meme_explain`, you can pass any of the meme names to be taken to their page on [knowyourmeme.com](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/). 

:warning: :warning: :warning: Content from knowyourmeme.com may be offensive. The authors of `memer` have no control over what you may see when using `meme_explain()`. 

```{r memeexplain, eval = F}
meme_explain("DistractedBf", launch = F, content_warning = T)
```
```

## Add your own meme! 

:warning: :warning: :warning: This is an advanced step. Proceed with caution.

If you want to add your own meme, use `memer:::meme_add()`:

1. Fork this repo and clone to your system. 
2. Add your meme file to `inst/extdata`.
    a. It should be a .png.
    b. It should be small: resolution of 72 and width no more than 500 pixels. 
2. Use `meme_add()` as below.   
```{r memeadd, eval = F}
setwd("path/to/your/memer")
meme_add("Memename", "memefile.png")
```
3. Re-install `memer` as below:
```{r, eval=F}
devtools::check(document = F)
devtools::install()
```
4. (Optional) If you would like your meme to be added to `memer`, submit a pull request!
